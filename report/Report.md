## Introduction

### 1.1 Background

An accident is when a vehicle collides with another vehicle, pedestrian, animal, obstacles, etc. Many factors contribute to collision including road environment, driving skills, speeding, impaired due to drug/alcohol, etc. The total number of persons and vehicles involved, pedestrians and injuries inflicted affect the severity of the accident. Many lives are lost worldwide just in road accidents.

### 1.2 Problem

The number of the accidents all around the world is on a continuous rise. A slight delay in the availability of the medical services may be the difference between life and death. This gap can sometimes be a result of the lack of knowledge of the severity of the accident. Having a clear picture of the accident can help authorities provide better emergency services. A model that can predict the severity by weighting in the different factors of weather, road, visibility, light conditions, etc. can be very effective to bridge the gap. Lot of the accidents are also the result of careless driving. How do the environmental factors impact, and their contributions? Taking all the factors into account is a necessity.

### 1.3 Interest

Following problem is of the interest of city authorities, department of transportation and people in healthcare. The predictability of the severity of an accident will help emergency staff to prepare well for the injured. It can define variables like how many ambulances, emergency medical staff and police are required on the site of accident. This can be a crucial information and decrease the time delay and save lives. City authorities and department of transportation can plan from patterns of weather and road environments and flag warning to people. The ultimate benefit will be to the local public who would receive better services and there can be probable decline in accidents due to warnings.

## Data

The data required here is one which contains details about the environmental factors as well as the driver details like if the person was under some alcohol/ drug influence. Environmental factors can even lead to a pre-assessment of the probability of travelling unfriendly conditions and warning can be flagged in advance. The data will be used for classification using Logistic Regression and predict the probabilities of the severity of accidents. We will use a historical dataset that fulfils all the requirements. The dataset for this project is provided by Coursera and is available to be downloaded from https://s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/cf-courses-data/CognitiveClass/DP0701EN/version-2/Data-Collisions.csv. The metadata for the dataset is available at https://s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/cf-courses-data/CognitiveClass/DP0701EN/version-2/Metadata.pdf. The metadata information was very useful in understanding the dataset well.

We have a total of 194673 rows and 38 columns in our dataset. There are a few unique id columns which will not be an optimum attribute for a model. The dataset has attributes including, speeding, road environments like visibility, light conditions and careless driving like inattention and driving under influence. Many attributes are unique identifiers for accident used by department of transportation and other organizations. A few of the identifiers or different ‘key’ columns had a description column describing the value. Thus, adding the redundant information. The target column ‘severitycode’ had two more columns with the redundant information. Therefore columns ‘severitycode.1’ – an identical column and ‘severitydesc’ were dropped. These attributes are dropped as they will help predict the severity of the accident.

 Most of the attributes required close observation and data cleaning. There are columns with as high as 80 to 97% of null values. We will have to impute, drop or work around them. Most of these were in the columns with “Yes” or “NO” values wherein only one of the values was available and the other was left out. These were easily replaced. For example, “speeding” attribute consisted of only ‘Y’ and ‘Nan’ values. Here, it can be inferred that only accident that involved speeding were documented as ‘Y’ and rest were left empty. The value “Nan” can be easily replaced as “N” for No or both “Y” and “Nan” can be replaced by “1” and “0” respectively. 

The columns ‘personcount’, ‘pedcount’, ‘vehcount’, ‘roadcond’, ‘weather’, ‘speeding’, ‘underinfl’, ‘inattentionind’ are of keen interest and would be good predictors of severity. More vehicles and people involved tends cause a higher severity accident. These variables capture the road environment which play a big roal in some accidents. Columns 'speeding', 'underinfl' and 'inattentionind' tells us about the careless driving of an individual.
